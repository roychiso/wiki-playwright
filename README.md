# Technical Assessment for QA Engineer at Ranger

This project is an end-to-end test automation suite built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) using **TypeScript**. It is designed for automated testing of web applications and serves as a submission for a technical assessment.


## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements

-   Node.js v22+
-   npm

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:roychiso/wiki-playwright.git
cd wiki-playwright
```

### 2. Setup

#### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Install Playwright browsers
```
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests

#### Run all tests

There's a `test` script in `package.json` so you can do:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### Run a specific test

Add `.only` to the specific test you want to run in isolation in `all.test.ts` and then run the same command:

```bash
npm run test
```


### Your Task

1. Implement a login test and capture the storage state so the remaining tests run as a logged in user
    - In `login.test.ts`, create a test that signs into Wikipedia
    - Create an account if you don't already have one
    - Add your sign in credentials to `.env`
2. Complete the Wikipedia search test
    - In `searchWikipedia.ts`, finish the existing test so that it correctly implements the test case in the file
3. Complete the Wikipedia home page actions test
    - In `wikipediaHomepageActions.ts`, finish the existing test so that it correctly implements the test case in the file
